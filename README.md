We take a name and then a letter and say how many times the letter appears in the name.
Open source does not mean unsafe though it can be seen by anyone and can be improved by anyone though the creator is the only one that can change the main version and open source does not mean public domain.
Licenses are set of rules on who can use and how something is used many are open source like can it be changed who can use it whether or not you can sell it.
Just add a branch if you want to modify it.
